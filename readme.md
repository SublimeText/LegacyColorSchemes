# Legacy Color Schemes

These are color schemes that were part of Sublime Text 2 and older builds
of Sublime Text 3. They are no longer maintained, but are available via
[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Color%20Scheme%20-%20Legacy).

## Installation

 - Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
 - Run the **Package Control: Install Package** command from the *Command Palette*
 - Type "Color Scheme - Legacy" and press *Enter*

Currently schemes won't be available right after package installation. You have to unlock them by adding this to your User settings:

    "show_legacy_color_schemes": true,

## Usage

For Sublime Text 3 build 3127 and newer, use the **UI: Select Color Scheme** command
in the *Command Palette*.
